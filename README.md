This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide
a "Graphical Access To Exterior" (GATE).  The goal is to
provide a generic GUI, within a javascript web browser, through
a TCP network (using the websocket protocol).  Plain text
protocol (simple human readable graphic commands) translators
to websockets protocol are also provided to connect user
applications to the browser via a C library or simple TCP
server.
