Description: Graphical Access To Exterior made simple
 This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide
 a "Graphical Access To Exterior" (GATE).  The goal is to
 provide a generic GUI, within a javascript web browser, through
 a TCP network (using the websocket protocol).  Plain text
 protocol (simple human readable graphic commands) translators
 to websockets protocol are also provided to connect user
 applications to the browser via a C library or simple TCP
 server.
